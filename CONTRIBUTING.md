- The steps to reproduce: "I run 'mxl_plyr video-file.mkv'"
- The outcome you expected: "I expected to see a playback of the video"
- The actual outcome: "I don't see the actual video images" or "I don't see the MXL Plyr at all, but a crash report"

When reporting an issue with a package, make sure to clearly state:

- The machine setup (as above)
- What version you're using: "3.0.0"
- Any MXL Plyr logs from the playback or any relevant system logs.
